# Problem 1

## 1. In the notes of Week 1, we compared & contrasted MLOps with DevOps. In this question, you need to understand what is meant by the term ***AIOps***, & then contrast it with MLOps.

Ans: 
- AIOps (term invented by Gartner)
  - AIOps is short for artificial intelligence for IT operations. It refers to multi-layered technology platforms 
 that automate and enhance IT operations through analytics and machine learning (ML). AIOps platforms leverage big data,
 collecting variety of data from various IT operations tools and devices in order to automatically spot and react to issues 
 in real-time while still providing traditional historical analytics.

  - It has 2 components :- 
    - Big data
    - ML
  - It aggregates observational data (such as job logs and monitoring systems) alongside engagement data inside a big data platform.
  - It then implements a comprehensive and Ml strategy againsed the data. The desired outcomes yield contiuous improvements and fixes.

- AIOps vs MLOps
  - Although the aim for both of them is two make our systems better we cannot mistakenly consider them to be similar as they are 
    different although there is a significant overlap.
  - While MLOps bridges the gap between cuilding of ML models and their execution, AIOps focuses on automating incidents management and intelligent root cause analysis.

## 2. ***Interpretable Machine Learning*** is another concept that has attracted lot of attention recently & is promoted by most of the MLOps frameworks. Explain what it means for a linear regression model to be interpretable. You may find [this resource](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) useful.
